0.5.0:
- Lots of translations (thanks to Weblate users!)
- Added "eye buttons" to toggle password visibility
- Enable backups of the files dir (if encrypted)
- Allow granting WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS directly in the app with root or Shizuku
- Provide geo: URIs (and not just OSM links)
- Fix: send OpenCelliD request only if API token is set
- Pictures taken with "fmd camera" now use 720x1280 (or lower) instead of the phone's highest resolution (to make uploads faster)
- Lots of internal cleanup
