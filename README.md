# FMD Android

Find your device via SMS, instant messengers, or a web interface
([FMD Server](https://gitlab.com/Nulide/findmydeviceserver)).

FMD ("FindMyDevice") allows you to locate, ring, wipe and issue other commands to your device when it's lost.
It aims to be a secure open source alternative to Google's Find My Device.

## Why?

I lost my brand new phone last week.
If I would have used Google Services I would have had a better chance of finding it.
Why has nobody created an open source application to find a lost device without giving up your privacy?

If you like FMD and want to support it, spread the word or donate.

## Why is it taking that long to fix x?

I am working full-time.
This project is my free-time and I have spent a lot of time in this and still will.
If there are bugs I will try to fix them as soon as possible, but my full-time job has priority.
If it takes too long to fix something you can of course try to fix it by yourself and contribute to this project.

Thanks,

Nulide
